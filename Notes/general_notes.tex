\section{Neural Grammar} 
Neural grammar has been defined only for "direct" models, meaning 
we have not implemented skip-connections and branches. Despite that, grammar is sufficiently general and 
defined for Linear, Recurrent and Convolutional networks

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{pooling}: grammar has not implemented yet any pooling operation
\end{itemize}

\section{Variational Auto Encoders}
We explore a deep range of variational auto-encoders, from the original formulation by Kingma and Welling to
more recent formulations.
